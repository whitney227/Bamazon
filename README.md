## Directions
In your terminal, cd into the Bamazon folder then run 
```
npm install
```
This will install the npm packages needed for all the node commands.

NOTE:  If you want to clone this app, you will need to include your own MySQL password.  Make sure you are not running anything on port 3306 before making any node commands.

Once you have installed both the Inquirer package and MySQL package, you can run the following node command in your terminal:
